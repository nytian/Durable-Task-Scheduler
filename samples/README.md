## Durable Extension for Microsoft Agent Framework

The [Durable Task extension for Microsoft Agent Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/durable-task/sdks/durable-agents-microsoft-agent-framework) lets you make any [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) agent durable with persistent sessions, built-in API endpoints, and distributed scaling — without changes to your agent logic. It also supports graph-based workflows via `WorkflowBuilder`.

> **Setup:** These samples live in the `microsoft/agent-framework` repo and are included here via a Git submodule. Run `git submodule update --init external/agent-framework` after cloning.
